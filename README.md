# Introduction

In this lab tutorial, we introduce you to some exciting hacking skills with [GDB](https://kuafu1994.github.io/GDB/). First, you should know a bit about GDB, a very powerful GNU debugger. In fact, we strongly suggest you do so for its efficiency without infinite amounts of print statements. Also, it will be great if you can pick up some assembly language, Chapter Two of [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/) will be wonderful material. In order to give you a deeper understanding of the Linux stack, we designed a small C program that you can hack based on [stack buffer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_buffer_overflow). Don't worry, this lab can be very easy with your basic knowledge of stack if you have attended Prof. Eric Lo's lecture.
